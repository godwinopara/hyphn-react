				</h2>
				<p>
					Without Testosterone, we as men would not be able to perform the duties of reproduction,
					produce muscle, or really show defining male characteristics. Understand that the
					endocrine system in your body is responsible for key bodily functions like reproduction,
					metabolism, sexual development, growth, and mood. It’s made up of glands that produce and
					release hormones into your body. Having healthy ratios of hormones is also important so
					your body can keep functioning in equilibrium.

				<p>
					Testosterone is one of the most powerful hormones in your body and we’ll be breaking it
					down here fully so you understand how it affects your health and well-being. Produced
					mainly in the testes and in small quantities in the adrenal glands, Testosterone is
					responsible for the development of male sex characteristics during development and
					secondary sex characteristics, such as voice deepening, sperm production, increased penis
					+ testes size, facial hair and muscle mass during adolescence and adulthood. Beyond these
					primary roles, Testosterone regulates libido (sex drive), bone mass, heart health, fat
					distribution, muscle mass and strength, energy levels and sperm + red blood cell
					production. There’s validated research, too, that Testosterone plays a role in
					anti-inflammation and cognitive functioning including mood, memory, and dopamine
					production.
