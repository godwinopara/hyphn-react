					We offer treatment for low testosterone in Akron. Low testosterone is a medical condition
					where the male testes produce little to no testosterone. Increasing testosterone can
					improve sex drive and sexual sensation, reduce fat mass, and increase lean body mass. It
					can also reduce the risks of developing a number of health conditions.

					A decrease in testosterone levels is to be expected as men age. Other factors can also
					contribute to low T, including chronic health issues such as diabetes or obesity,
					medications such as corticosteroids or trauma. Our comprehensive health assessment tests
					for low testosterone levels as well as a multitude of other related issues and can be
					treated with customized, testosterone replacement therapy treatment plans.
